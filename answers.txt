Part 1
Q 1
 if x = 2 and y = 5,		output = x is 2
 if x = 3 and y = 1,		output = nothing
 if x = 1 and y = 1, 		output = x is 1
 if x = 4 and y = 3, 		output = z is 7

Q 2
if x = 3 and y = 5,		y = 1
if x = 2 and y = 5,		y = 1

Q 3
the code outputs 
	2
	4
	6
	8
	10	
and its run through the loop body 10 times

Q 4
the loop is skipped because the initial value of 'i' does not 
satisfy the condition stated
